p4a.ploneevent Changes
======================

p4a.ploneevent 0.7 - Unreleased
===============================

* Renamed ui.kss to p4a.event.ui and registered same named browser resource.
  ++resource++p4a.event.ui.kss seems not be a better choice than 
  ++resource++ui.kss for such a specific edit form kss file and/or resource 
  name. I've added the missing kss registry file to generic setup.  [saily]

* Added german translations which are identical to google calendars'.
  [saily]
  
* Updated indent level to 4 spaces in recurrence/schemaextender.py.
  [saily]

* Added locales directory and used i18ndude to grep all message ids. Updated 
  schemaextender.py to use zope MessageFactory instead of untranslateable 
  strings.  [saily]

* Added missing dependency to p4a.common, which is required by the recurring 
  view (from p4a.common.dtutils import dt2DT).  [saily]
  
p4a.ploneevent 0.6 (2009-05-17)
===============================

* Added KSS UI enhancements, reordered and relabled recurrence fields 
  to better describe field functions (aaronvanderlip)
